In this article, we will explore some of the features that make vArranger a powerful and versatile software for music arrangers. Whether you want to play styles from different brands, host VST plugins, use your own samples, or create harmonies and effects, vArranger has something for you.
 
## Play Styles from Different Brands
 
One of the main features of vArranger is that it can play and arrange music styles from different hardware arrangers, such as Yamaha, Korg, Ketron, Roland and more[^1^]. You can load thousands of styles in various formats, such as SFF 1, SFF 2, X1/X4/X8, G800/G1000 and more[^1^]. You can also edit the styles, change the instruments, adjust the tempo and volume, and save them as new styles.
 
vArranger can also recognize the chords you play on your keyboard or guitar in real-time and generate an auto-accompaniment based on them[^1^]. You can choose between intelligent fingered mode or single finger mode, depending on your preference. You can also switch between split or full keyboard mode, and use up to three MIDI inputs simultaneously[^1^].
 
## Host VST Plugins
 
vArranger can also host up to 16 VST instruments plugins (VST2.4 32 Bit or 64 Bit) and use them as sound sources for your styles[^1^]. You can load your favorite VST plugins, such as pianos, synths, guitars, drums and more, and assign them to different tracks. You can also use three auxiliary VST effects and one master VST effect to add reverb, chorus, delay and other effects to your sound[^1^].
 
vArranger comes with a built-in GM2 software synthesizer that offers 256 voice high quality sound synthesis and 16 tracks multitimbral[^1^]. It also supports instrument definition files (INS) that allow you to easily select the instruments of your MIDI synthesizer[^1^]. You can also use your own samples in Soundfonts SF2 or SFZ format and load up to 4GB of samples or more with Windows 64 Bit[^1^].
 
## Create Harmonies and Effects
 
vArranger can also help you create harmonies and effects for your melody line. You can use the harmony feature to add a harmonized second voice to your melody line, either in fixed scale mode or auto mode[^1^]. You can also use the second voice feature to add a different instrument to your melody line[^1^].
 
vArranger also offers advanced arranger features that allow you to control the variations, fill-ins, sync start/stop, tap tempo, tempo lock, octave, transpose, manual bass, bass to lowest and more[^1^]. You can also use the fade in/out feature to gradually increase or decrease the volume of your music[^1^]. You can also use the split point feature to set the point where the keyboard is split into two zones: one for chords and one for melody[^1^].
