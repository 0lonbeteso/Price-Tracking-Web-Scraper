Once you have found the subtitle file, you can download it to your computer. The subtitle file usually has a .srt or .sub extension, and it contains the text and timing of the dialogues in the movie. Make sure you save the subtitle file in the same folder as the video file, and give them the same name. For example, if your video file is called I.Want.You.2012.1080p.BluRay.x264.mp4, your subtitle file should be called I.Want.You.2012.1080p.BluRay.x264.srt.
 
## Step 2: Sync the Subtitle File with the Video Player
 
The second step is to sync the subtitle file with the video player of your choice. There are many video players that support subtitles, such as [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html), [MPV](https://mpv.io/), and [PotPlayer](https://potplayer.daum.net/). You can open the video file with any of these players, and they will automatically detect and load the subtitle file if it has the same name and location as the video file.
 
However, sometimes the subtitle file may not be perfectly synced with the video file, meaning that the subtitles may appear too early or too late on the screen. In that case, you can adjust the subtitle delay or offset using the video player settings. For example, in VLC Media Player, you can press H or G keys to increase or decrease the subtitle delay by 50 milliseconds. You can also use J or K keys to move the subtitles up or down on the screen.
