Beginning with classifying signals, the book moves on to other topics such as convolution and correlation of signals, CTFS, DTFS, CTFT, Sampling, Laplace Transform, and z-Transform. One complete chapter is devoted to MATLAB programs and another chapter is entirely devoted to Hilbert Transform. The subject matter is presented by illustrating the concepts first through abstract mathematical reasoning and then through solved examples[^2^].
 
Solving the number of multiple choice questions and numerical exercises at the end of the chapters will help students to apply the concepts learnt in the chapters. The book also covers the topics of Stochastic Nonlinear Filters, Digital Signal Processing, Statistical Signal Processing, and Digital Communication, which are relevant for modern applications of signals and systems[^2^].
 
The book is available in both print and digital formats. The digital format can be accessed through Google Drive[^1^] or Google Books[^2^]. The print format can be ordered from Oxford University Press[^3^] or other online retailers.

The book has received positive reviews from students and teachers alike. One reviewer wrote, "This book is a very great book helps a lot in clearing the concepts." Another reviewer wrote, "Best book for deep knowledge as well as competition...". The book is praised for its clarity, depth, and coverage of the subject.
