- Choose your character wisely. Crusader Kings II allows you to play as any landed noble in the game world, from counts to emperors. Each character has their own traits, skills, ambitions, relationships, and challenges. Some characters are easier to play than others, depending on your goals and playstyle. For example, if you want to expand your realm quickly, you might want to choose a character with high martial skill, aggressive traits, and a strong claim on a neighboring territory. If you want to focus on diplomacy and intrigue, you might want to choose a character with high diplomacy skill, scheming traits, and a network of allies and spies.
- Manage your vassals carefully. As your realm grows, you will have to delegate some of your authority to your vassals, who are your subordinate nobles. Vassals provide you with troops and taxes, but they also have their own interests and opinions. You will have to balance your vassals' happiness and loyalty with your own power and prestige. You can improve your vassals' opinion of you by granting them titles, lands, favors, gifts, or honorary positions. You can also use diplomacy, intrigue, or war to deal with troublesome vassals who rebel or plot against you.
- Expand your dynasty strategically. One of the main goals of Crusader Kings II is to ensure the survival and success of your dynasty. You can do this by marrying your family members to other nobles, either for love or for political gain. You can also use matrilineal marriages to pass on your dynasty name and bloodline to your female descendants. You can also legitimize bastards or adopt children to increase your number of heirs. However, be careful not to create too many rival branches of your dynasty that might compete with you for titles or inheritance.
- Embrace the roleplay. Crusader Kings II is not just a strategy game, but also a roleplaying game. You can shape your character's personality and actions based on their traits, events, decisions, and interactions with other characters. You can also immerse yourself in the historical and cultural context of the game world, which is richly detailed and dynamic. You can follow the historical events and characters that shaped the medieval era, or create your own alternate history with your choices and actions.

Crusader Kings II is a game that offers endless possibilities and challenges for the aspiring ruler. With these tips and tricks, you can make the most out of your experience and enjoy the game to its fullest.
