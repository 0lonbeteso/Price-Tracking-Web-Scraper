At a dinner party hosted by Ronnie and Veronica, Pat meets Tiffany, Veronica's friend and Ronnie's coworker. Tiffany is a young widow who lost her husband in a car accident. She also suffers from depression and has a reputation for being promiscuous and unstable. She tells Pat that she knows about his situation and offers to help him get in touch with Nikki if he agrees to be her partner in a dance competition. Pat initially refuses, but later changes his mind when he learns that Nikki will be at the competition.
 
Pat and Tiffany start practicing for the competition, which is a mix of various dance styles. They also bond over their shared experiences of mental illness and grief. They become friends and confidants, and gradually develop feelings for each other. However, they both deny their attraction and insist that they are only doing this for Nikki.
 
Meanwhile, Pat's father, who is a passionate Philadelphia Eagles fan and an obsessive-compulsive gambler, believes that Pat is his lucky charm and bets all his money on the Eagles winning their games. He also makes a parlay bet with his friend Randy that the Eagles will win their next game and that Pat and Tiffany will score at least a 5 out of 10 in the dance competition. Pat agrees to the bet, hoping that it will help his father financially and emotionally.
 
On the day of the competition, Pat sees Nikki in the audience and decides to dedicate his performance to her. He tells Tiffany that he loves her as a friend and thanks her for everything she has done for him. Tiffany is hurt by his words and runs away. Pat chases after her and confesses that he loves her as more than a friend. He kisses her and they return to the stage to perform their dance routine.
 
They score exactly a 5 out of 10, which means that they win the bet for Pat's father and also qualify for the next round of the competition. Nikki approaches Pat and tells him that she is proud of him and wants to get back together with him. Pat rejects her and tells her that he is in love with Tiffany. He then embraces Tiffany and they kiss again.
 
The film ends with Pat and Tiffany celebrating with their families and friends. Pat narrates that he has found his silver lining in Tiffany and that he is happy with his life.
