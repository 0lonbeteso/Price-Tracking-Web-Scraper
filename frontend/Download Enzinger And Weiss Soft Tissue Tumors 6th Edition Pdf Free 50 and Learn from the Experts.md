Soft tissue tumors are a diverse and challenging group of neoplasms that affect the skeletal muscles, connective tissue, fat, and related structures. They can be benign or malignant, and they can have various clinical, radiologic, molecular, and histologic features. The diagnosis and management of these tumors require a multidisciplinary approach that involves pathologists, clinicians, radiologists, and molecular geneticists.

Enzinger and Weiss's Soft Tissue Tumors is the most comprehensive and authoritative reference available on soft tissue pathology. It has been published for more than 35 years and has been updated through seven editions. The latest edition, edited by Drs. John R. Goldblum, Andrew L. Folpe, and Sharon W. Weiss, covers the full spectrum of soft tissue tumors with detailed, well-written, and logically organized chapters. It offers clear guidance to practicing and trainee pathologists on diagnosis of tumors by microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and molecular genetics, as well as a significant amount of clinically significant information of interest to the clinicians who most frequently see these diseases â dermatologists, orthopaedists, and oncologists.
 
The book provides practical information on differential diagnosis of tumors of the skeletal muscles, connective tissue, fat, and related structures, helping pathologists accurately diagnose and confidently sign out pathology reports on even the most challenging cases. It also incorporates new knowledge on recently identified entities, next-generation sequencing (NGS), molecular diagnostic techniques, and immunohistochemical and genetic features of soft tissue tumors, providing up-to-date diagnostic and prognostic information that will inform day-to-day therapeutic decisions. The book features nearly 2,000 high-quality images that clearly capture the clinical, macroscopic and microscopic features of benign and malignant conditions, helping pathologists relate these characteristics to their specific classifications.
 
Enzinger and Weiss's Soft Tissue Tumors is a must-have reference for anyone who deals with soft tissue pathology. It is available in hardcover and e-book formats from Elsevier Health Sciences. The e-book version can be accessed online or downloaded as a PDF file for free from various websites[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. The book has 1,304 pages and costs $399.99.
  
Soft tissue tumors are relatively rare, accounting for about 0.7% of all new cancer cases and 0.8% of all cancer deaths in the United States in 2020. The estimated annual incidence rate of soft tissue sarcomas is about 3.3 per 100,000 persons, and the estimated annual mortality rate is about 1.3 per 100,000 persons[^2^]. Soft tissue tumors can affect people of any age, but they are more common in adults older than 55 years[^3^]. Some soft tissue tumors have a genetic predisposition or are associated with environmental factors such as radiation exposure or certain chemicals[^4^].
 
The diagnosis of soft tissue tumors can be challenging because of their nonspecific clinical presentation and their diverse histologic subtypes. The most important clinical features that raise the suspicion of malignancy include tumor size of 5 cm or larger, location on or below the fascia, masses matted to surrounding structures, and rapid growth. However, these features are not always reliable, and some benign tumors may mimic malignant ones. Therefore, imaging studies and biopsy are often necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the grade and stage of the tumor.

The treatment of soft tissue tumors depends on the type, location, size, grade, and stage of the tumor, as well as the patient's age, general health, and preferences. The mainstay of treatment for most soft tissue sarcomas is surgical resection with adequate margins to achieve local control and prevent recurrence. In some cases, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used to improve survival or reduce the extent of surgery. For some benign tumors, such as lipomas and epidermal cysts, surgical excision may be performed for cosmetic reasons or to relieve symptoms. Other benign tumors may be observed or treated with nonsurgical modalities such as aspiration, injection, or cryotherapy.
