# How to Strafe Jump in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
 
Strafe jumping is a technique that allows you to move faster and jump farther in first-person shooter games like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (COD4). It involves using the air strafing mechanic, which lets you change your direction in mid-air by moving your mouse and pressing the corresponding movement keys. By doing this, you can gain extra speed and momentum, which can help you reach places that are normally inaccessible or give you an advantage in combat.

In this article, we will explain how to strafe jump in COD4, what are the benefits of doing it, and how to use a script to make it easier.
 
## How to Strafe Jump in COD4
 
To perform a strafe jump in COD4, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Run forward and jump at the edge of a platform or a slope. You can use the sprint button to gain more speed.
2. While in the air, release the forward key and press either the left or right key, depending on which direction you want to strafe.
3. At the same time, move your mouse smoothly in the same direction as your strafe key. This will make you turn slightly in the air and increase your speed.
4. Before you land, release the strafe key and press the forward key again. This will make you continue moving forward with the speed you gained from the strafe jump.
5. Repeat these steps for each consecutive jump. You can also alternate between left and right strafes to create a zig-zag pattern.

- It allows you to move faster than normal, which can help you escape from enemies, chase down targets, or reach objectives quicker.

- It allows you to surprise your enemies with unexpected angles of attack, or dodge their fire by changing your direction in mid-air.
- It allows you to show off your skills and have fun with the game physics.

## How to Use a Script to Strafe Jump
 
Strafe jumping can be difficult to master, especially for beginners. It requires precise timing, coordination, and mouse control. If you want to make it easier, you can use a script that automates some of the steps for you. A script is a piece of code that you can insert into your game configuration file (config.cfg) that executes certain commands when you press a key.
 
One example of a strafe jump script for COD4 is this one[^1^]:
  ```cfg seta strafe1 "cl_yawspeed 100; +left; +moveleft; wait 15; -moveleft; -left; cl_yawspeed 140" seta strafe2 "cl_yawspeed 100; +right; +moveright; wait 15; -moveright; -right; cl_yawspeed 140" bind mouse1 "+attack; +speed" bind mouse2 "+speed" bind mwheeldown "vstr strafe1" bind mwheelup "vstr strafe2" ```  
This script does the following:

- It sets two variables (strafe1 and strafe2) that contain the commands for left and right strafes respectively. The commands include changing the yawspeed (the speed at which you turn), pressing and releasing the left or right keys, and adding a wait time (the duration of the strafe).
- It binds the mouse1 button (left click) to both attack and sprint, so you can shoot and run at the same time.
- It binds the mouse2 button (right click) to sprint only, so you can use it as an alternative to shift.
- It binds the mwheeldown button (scroll down) to execute the strafe1 variable, which performs a 8cf37b1e13
