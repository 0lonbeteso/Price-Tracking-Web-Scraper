Mortal Kombat Project 4.7 is a fan-made modification of the popular Mortal Kombat series, created by Prist using the MUGEN engine. It was released in 2008 and features enhanced graphics, gameplay, and roster of characters from the original Mortal Kombat games.
 
According to MKA, a YouTube channel dedicated to Mortal Kombat MUGEN games, Mortal Kombat Project 4.7 is a rare and improved version of Mortal Kombat Project 4.3, which was also created by Prist[^1^]. Some of the changes made between MKP 4.3 and MKP 4.7 include:

- More characters, such as Chameleon, Khameleon, Motaro, Shao Kahn, and Goro.
- More stages, such as The Pit III, The Subway, The Bank, and The Armory.
- More fatalities, brutalities, animalities, babalities, and friendships.
- More game modes, such as Team Battle, Survival, and Training.
- Better AI, sound effects, and animations.

Mortal Kombat Project 4.7 is not the latest version of the game, however. In 2020, MKA uploaded a video of Mortal Kombat Project 4.8[^2^], which has some minor tweaks and additions to MKP 4.7. However, MKP 4.8 is also hard to find online, as it was only released on 4Shared.
