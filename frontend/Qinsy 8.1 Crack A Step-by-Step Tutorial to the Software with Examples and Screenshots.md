In this article, we will explore some of the features and functions of QINSy 8.1 in more detail.
 
## Navigation and Data Acquisition
 
QINSy 8.1 allows users to plan and execute hydrographic surveys with ease and accuracy. Users can define survey areas, lines, waypoints, offsets, and other parameters in the QINSy Console application. The Console also displays real-time navigation and sensor data, such as position, heading, speed, depth, sound velocity, etc. Users can monitor the quality and coverage of the data using various graphical and numerical indicators.
 
QINSy 8.1 supports a wide range of sensors and platforms, which can be configured and calibrated in the QINSy Database Setup application. Users can also create custom drivers for new or unsupported sensors using the QINSy Driver Development Kit (DDK). QINSy 8.1 can handle multiple sensors and platforms simultaneously, which enables users to conduct surveys with multiple vessels or vehicles.
 
## Post-Processing and Quality Control
 
QINSy 8.1 provides users with powerful tools for post-processing and quality control of the acquired data. Users can import, export, edit, filter, smooth, correct, merge, and analyze the data in the QINSy Qimera application. Qimera also offers advanced features such as automatic sound velocity correction, dynamic surface generation, multibeam backscatter processing, water column imaging, etc.
 
QINSy 8.1 also includes the QINSy Qloud application, which is a web-based platform for data management and collaboration. Users can upload, share, view, and comment on the data online using any device with a web browser. Qloud also allows users to generate reports and statistics on the data quality and coverage.
 
## Charting and Visualization
 
QINSy 8.1 enables users to create and edit georeferenced charts and 3D models of the surveyed area. Users can use the QINSy Qarto application to produce vector or raster charts in various formats and standards, such as S-57, S-63, BSB, GeoTIFF, etc. Users can also add annotations, symbols, layers, grids, scales, legends, etc. to the charts.
