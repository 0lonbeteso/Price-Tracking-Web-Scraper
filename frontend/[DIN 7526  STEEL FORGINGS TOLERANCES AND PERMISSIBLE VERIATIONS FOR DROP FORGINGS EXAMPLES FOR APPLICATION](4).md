# DIN 7526: A Standard for Steel Forgings and Ferronickels
 
DIN 7526 is a German standard that specifies the tolerances and permissible variations for steel forgings, especially drop forgings, and provides examples for their application. It also specifies an infrared absorption method for the determination of sulfur content in ferronickels, which are alloys of iron and nickel used in stainless steel production.
 
Steel forgings are metal parts that are shaped by hammering or pressing at high temperatures. They have high strength, toughness and resistance to wear and fatigue. Drop forgings are a type of steel forgings that are produced by dropping a hammer onto a heated metal blank placed in a die. Drop forgings are used for various applications such as automotive, aerospace, railway, mining and construction.

Ferronickels are alloys of iron and nickel with a nickel content of 5 % to 40 %. They are used as raw materials for stainless steel production, as they provide corrosion resistance, ductility and weldability. The sulfur content in ferronickels affects the quality and properties of stainless steel, so it is important to measure it accurately. DIN 7526 specifies an infrared absorption method after combustion in an induction furnace for the determination of the sulfur content in ferronickels in the range of 0.002 % to 0.12 %. The method is applicable to normal production operations.
 
DIN 7526 is based on the international standards ISO 7526:2020 and EN ISO 7526:2020, which are identical to each other. DIN 7526 was published by the German Institute for Standardisation (Deutsches Institut fÃ¼r Normung) in June 2020.

In this article, we will explain the main features and benefits of DIN 7526 standard for steel forgings and ferronickels. We will also provide some examples of how this standard is applied in different industries and sectors.
 
## Features and Benefits of DIN 7526 Standard
 
DIN 7526 standard has several features and benefits that make it a useful and reliable reference for steel forgings and ferronickels. Some of these are:
 
- It provides clear and consistent definitions and classifications of steel forgings and ferronickels, as well as their dimensions, shapes, weights and tolerances.
- It specifies the methods and procedures for testing and inspecting the quality and properties of steel forgings and ferronickels, such as chemical composition, mechanical properties, surface condition, hardness, microstructure and non-destructive testing.
- It ensures the compatibility and interchangeability of steel forgings and ferronickels with other standards and specifications, such as ISO, EN, ASTM and ASME.
- It improves the efficiency and productivity of steel forging and ferronickel production processes, as well as the performance and durability of the final products.
- It reduces the risks of defects, failures and accidents caused by poor quality or inappropriate steel forgings and ferronickels.
- It enhances the customer satisfaction and trust in steel forging and ferronickel products and services.
