- Contour Generator: This module allows you to create contour lines with variable offset from a control object. You can use harmonic functions to modulate the offset and create complex shapes such as rosettes. To use this module, you need to select a curve object in your document and click on the Contour Generator button. A dialog box will appear where you can adjust the parameters of the contour, such as number of steps, amplitude, frequency, phase, etc. You can also use the Function Editor to create custom functions for the contour. When you are satisfied with the preview, click on OK and the contour will be created as a new object.
- Pattern Generator: This module allows you to create guilloche patterns between two selected curves in your document. You need to have two curve shapes that act as envelopes for the pattern. The resulting fill follows the path of both envelopes. To use this module, you need to select two curve objects in your document and click on the Pattern Generator button. A dialog box will appear where you can adjust the parameters of the pattern, such as number of steps, amplitude, frequency, phase, etc. You can also use the Function Editor to create custom functions for the pattern. When you are satisfied with the preview, click on OK and the pattern will be created as a new object.
- Function Editor: This module allows you to create mathematical functions used by the Contour Generator and Pattern Generator modules. You can specify a function description as a set of Fourier coefficients or you can draw a function in your document and have the Function Editor digitize it and produce the coefficients automatically. To use this module, you can either launch it from the Contour Generator or Pattern Generator dialogs or click on the Function Editor button on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can edit or create functions using a graphical interface or a text editor.
