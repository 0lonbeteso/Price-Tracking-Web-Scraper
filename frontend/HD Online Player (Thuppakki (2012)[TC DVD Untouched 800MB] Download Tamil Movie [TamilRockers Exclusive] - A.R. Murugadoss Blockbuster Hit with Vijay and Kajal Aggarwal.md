The history of Marjam Kali Pattukal is not very clear, but there are different opinions and theories about its origin and development. Some scholars trace it back to the Jewish wedding songs and dances from the diaspora, as they find similarities between the Malabar Jewish and Christian traditions[^2^]. Others suggest that it is derived from the Sangam Kali or Yathra Kali, which are performance dance forms of Brahmins in Kerala[^2^]. Another possibility is that it is influenced by the Portuguese missionaries who arrived in Kerala in the 16th century and introduced Western musical elements[^2^].
 
Whatever the origin, Marjam Kali Pattukal have been practiced by the Saint Thomas Christians for centuries as a way of celebrating their faith and culture. The songs are based on the apocryphal Acts of Thomas, which narrate the life and missionary work of Thomas the Apostle, who is believed to have brought Christianity to India in the first century AD. The songs also reflect the history and struggles of the Christian community in Kerala, as they faced persecution, discrimination, and colonization. The songs are composed in Malayalam, but some of them have words or phrases from Syriac, Tamil, and Portuguese, which show the linguistic diversity and influence of the community[^2^].
 
Marjam Kali Pattukal are usually performed by a group of 12 singers, representing the 12 apostles, who form a circle around a brass lamp. They move in a clockwise direction, clapping their hands and striking small sticks. They sing 14 stanzas that cover different aspects of Thomas' life and work, such as his arrival in Kerala, his miracles, his friendship with King Gondophares, his establishment of churches and crosses, his journey to China, and his martyrdom in Mylapore. The songs have a rhythmic and melodic structure that varies according to the mood and theme of each stanza. The songs also have a spiritual and moral dimension, as they convey messages of love, peace, unity, and harmony[^2^] [^3^].
