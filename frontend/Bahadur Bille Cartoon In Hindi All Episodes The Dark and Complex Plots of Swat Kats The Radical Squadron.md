# Bahadur Bille: The Swat Kats of India
 
Bahadur Bille was the Hindi name given to the popular American animated series Swat Kats: The Radical Squadron, which aired on Cartoon Network in India in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The show featured two anthropomorphic cats, T-Bone and Razor, who were former fighter pilots turned vigilantes, fighting crime and evil forces in the futuristic city of Megakat City.
 
The show was dubbed in Hindi by Sahara India Media Communication Ltd., and the voice actors gave a distinct Indian flavor to the characters and dialogues. For instance, T-Bone and Razor were renamed Bahadur Bille and Chatur Bille respectively, and their catchphrases were translated as "Ab dhamaka hoga!" (Now there will be a blast!) and "Ab mazaa aayega!" (Now it will be fun!). The show also featured references to Indian culture and mythology, such as the villainous Dark Kat being called Kaal Kat or Shaitan Kat, and the giant robot Macrobots being called Mahabali.

The show was a huge hit among Indian kids, who loved the action-packed adventures, the cool gadgets and vehicles, and the witty humor of Bahadur Bille and Chatur Bille. The show also had a loyal fan following among adults, who appreciated the quality animation, the complex plots, and the dark themes. The show had 25 episodes in two seasons, and was cancelled by Hanna-Barbera due to low ratings in the US. However, it continued to air on Cartoon Network India for several years, and became a cult classic among Indian fans.
 
Bahadur Bille was one of the first cartoons to introduce Indian kids to the genre of sci-fi and fantasy, and inspired many of them to pursue their creative passions. The show also had a positive impact on the Indian animation industry, as it showed the potential of producing high-quality content for a global audience. Bahadur Bille remains one of the most beloved cartoons in India, and is fondly remembered by many as the Swat Kats of India.
  
But the story of Bahadur Bille is not over yet. After almost three decades, the show is getting a reboot, titled Swat-Kats: Revolution, which will be co-produced by Toonz Media Group and the original creators Christian and Yvon Tremblay[^1^] [^2^]. The reboot will feature new characters and villains, along with the familiar faces of Bahadur Bille and Chatur Bille, who will continue to protect Megakat City from evil forces.
 
The reboot has been in the works for a long time, as the Tremblay brothers launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2015 to fund their goal of reviving the show. However, they faced many challenges and rejections from various platforms and studios, until they found a partner in Toonz Media Group, which is one of the leading animation companies in India[^1^] [^3^]. The reboot will be distributed globally by Toonz, which launched its own international linear kids channel in 2021[^2^].
 
The fans of Bahadur Bille are eagerly waiting for the reboot, which promises to bring back the nostalgia and excitement of the original show, along with new twists and surprises. The reboot will also introduce a new generation of viewers to the world of Swat-Kats, and inspire them with its themes of courage, friendship, and justice. Bahadur Bille is not just a cartoon, but a cultural phenomenon that has left a lasting impact on millions of Indian kids and adults alike.
