With so many options of French films on Netflix, it can be hard to decide what to watch. If you're in the mood for a French comedy, one of the best choices is The Intouchables, a heartwarming and hilarious story of an unlikely friendship between a wealthy quadriplegic and his caregiver. The film was a huge hit in France and abroad, and made Omar Sy a star in Hollywood. It is far superior to its American remake The Upside, which starred Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston and failed to capture the charm and humor of the original.
