1. Download a cheat engine such as Cheat Engine or Game Hacker. These are programs that can modify the game's memory and data to change various aspects of the game, such as resources, units, health, etc.
2. Run the cheat engine and select the game's process from the list. You may need to run the game first before you can see it in the cheat engine.
3. Search for the values that you want to change in the game, such as money, power, or health. You can use different search types, such as exact value, unknown initial value, increased value, decreased value, etc.
4. Once you find the values that you want to change, you can edit them to your desired amount. For example, if you want to have unlimited money, you can change the value of your money to a very large number.
5. Alternatively, you can also use cheat tables or trainers that are pre-made by other users. These are files that contain a list of cheats that you can activate or deactivate with a click of a button. You can download cheat tables or trainers from various websites, such as Cheat Happens or MrAntiFun.
6. Another way to hack the game is to use mods or custom maps that can alter the gameplay, graphics, or content of the game. Mods are modifications that can add new features, units, factions, missions, etc. to the game. Custom maps are user-made scenarios that can have different objectives, settings, or challenges.
7. You can download mods or custom maps from various websites, such as Mod DB or C&C Labs. To install them, you may need to follow the instructions provided by the mod or map creator. Some mods or maps may require you to copy and paste files into the game's directory, while others may have an installer that does it for you.
8. To play with mods or custom maps, you may need to launch the game with a different executable file or use a mod launcher that can load them for you. For example, if you want to play with the Kane's Wrath Singleplayer Map Pack 2021 by Erlnite[^2^], which is a collection of 30 custom maps for Kane's Wrath[^2^], you need to launch the game with KWSPMP.exe instead of C&C3.exe.

By following these steps, you can hack Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars - Kane's Wrath and enjoy the game in a new way. However, hacking the game may also have some risks and drawbacks. For instance, hacking the game may cause bugs, crashes, or errors that can affect your gameplay. Moreover, hacking the game may also violate the terms of service or end-user license agreement of the game developer or publisher. Therefore, you should hack the game at your own risk and discretion.
